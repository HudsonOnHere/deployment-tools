### Installer.ps1

This installer script is used to automate multiple software download and installs on a local machine. The idea is that you can save space and time by having an automated download and install for your line of business apps, rather than transferring the same handful of MSI installer files to the target machine with every deployment.

run `Get-Help .\installer.ps1 -full` for all of the details and example usage.
